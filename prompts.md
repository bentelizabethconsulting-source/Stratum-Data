# Stratum-Data — Original Design Prompts
*A record of the prompts used in the conversation that produced the Stratum-Data project, in order. Useful for understanding the design intent, restarting the conversation in a new session, or continuing development with an AI assistant.*

1. I should clarify that the columns are keywords obtained from the text of the emails not the subject lines of the emails

2. Please update the website.

3. OK, so now I want to apply insights from my email text keyword analysis to another kind of coded numeric dataset, which could be something like flight logs, bank transfers, or purchases. These data sets all have dates and times in common. Can we make it so that associations found in email text keywords (the modules we identified) can have relevant timestamps extracted, and then those other sets which also have timestamps can be searched for additional co-occurrences

4. Can we update the text on the landing page to reflect the cross fusion capabilities

5. Can we change the grey fonts on the black background to light green and change the font to calibri

6. I don't have the expertise to test the code and make sure the analyses work, especially ones like SEM structures. How can I get this website code made publicly available so people can download it and test it?

7. Yes, please draft the readme and I will open the account.

8. The repository is Stratum-Data, does that influence the readme or files

9. how do I download the site html as well as the readme in right formats

10. there is no file download button/

11. I find your interface kind of irritating, the buttons are too small and should have text associated with them, because I can't guess what other people think things like a save button or download button should look like

12. Thanks Claude. May I save this conversation if I want to actually build the backend for the site someday

13. Can you help me by allowing me to save this conversation as a .md file called notes.md and make it downloadable

14. Do you have a record of the prompts I used?

15. Please do that and make a file prompts.md to document them

*Note: The first prompt in this conversation (not listed above) was the original project brief describing the platform concept — a website that allows people to take complex data and gain insights from it via mathematical and statistical strategies like network analysis and structural equation modeling, using the JMail.world email corpus as the example use case, with emails as rows and subjects/keywords as columns, looking for network modules that co-associate.*
